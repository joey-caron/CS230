# CS230
Repository for the work in my CS 230 Operating Platforms course at SNHU

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client for this project, The Gaming Room, is a company that created a succesful Android app called "Draw it or Lose it". They want to create a web-based application based on their Android app, that would allow users accross various devices to play the game with and against each other

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I feel I did a decent job with getting all of the information across in a way that someone without in-depth programming knowledge could comprehend. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Having a design document, that needs to be written in layman's terms for clarity, is helpful in allowing me to visualize a storyboard for what needs to be done with the code. Having a mental picture of what needs to be done is very helpful when trying to figure out how to code something in a project file.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I could have gone into slightly greater detail with my recommendations section at the end of the document. Keeping things clear and concise is all well and good, but to truly show understanding of the subject matter when making a recommendation, a more complete pros and cons list would have been helpful I think. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  From the requirements I was given, I felt the user's needs boiled down to the following: allow players to make teams made up of multiple players, player and team names must be unique with a way to check that the desired name is available, and that each game can only exist in one instance on the game server. To accomplish all of this, I made use of a singleton tester, to ensure nothing, from user and team names to game instances could be duplicated. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing anything, as they are the customer. First and foremost to give them anything other than the finished product they are paying for would be unethical. If someone is paying me to provide a basketball hoop, and I take their money but only give them a volleyball net, I'm very much in the wrong. They may have gotten something similar in a loose sense, but it isn't what they were paying me for.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  When it comes to designing software, my approach is to research everything possible related to the task at hand. For starters, I'm still very much a novice when it comes to programming, so there are likely things that can or cannot be done that I am unaware of. In order to create a software application, whether for myself or someone else, I need to know what is and isn't possible before diving in head first and wasting time attempting to do something that can't be done, or over engineering something that could be done in a much simpler manner. Maybe someday I might be able to program an application without needing to research everything beforehand, but if so that day is far off for sure.
